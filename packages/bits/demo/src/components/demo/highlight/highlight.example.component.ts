        Hello, it's me, I was wondering,<br>
        If after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything,<br>
        They say that time's supposed to heal, yeah,<br>
        But I ain't done much healing,<br>
        <br>
        Hello, can you hear me?,<br>
        I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be,<br>
        When we were younger and free,<br>
        I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet,<br>
        <br>
        There's such a difference between us,<br>
        And a million miles,<br>
        <br>
        Hello from the other side,<br>
        I must've called a thousand times ,<br>
        To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done,<br>
        But when I call you never seem to be home,<br>
        <br>
        Hello from the outside,<br>
        At least I can say that I've tried ,<br>
        To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart,<br>
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
