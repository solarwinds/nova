<h1>What is a convenience component?</h1>
<p>
    A convenience component is a composition of several bits components into a larger component that's
    pre-configured/pre-implemented to accommodate the majority of use cases within its problem set.
    In addition to reusability, a convenience component is optimized for ease-of-use, meaning its
    internal workings are hidden away and you shouldn't have to fuss too much to get it working. The
    public interface is ideally as small as possible and relatively straight-forward.
</p>

<h1>Sounds great! What's the catch?</h1>
<p>
    Well, there are a couple of things that could be considered drawbacks, but hopefully the benefits,
    more often than not, outweigh any downsides.

        <p>
            An easy-to-use, small interface comes at the cost of flexibility which means, if you want a
            convenience component to do something out of the ordinary, you may need to instead use the
            requisite bits components to create your own custom version of the larger component.
        </p>

        <p>
            This relative lack of flexibility may be an insurmountable inconvenience in some cases, but to
            mitigate at least some of the reduction in flexibility, wherever it's practical, a convenience
            component will provide projection slots to:
        </p>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Allow certain nested components to be optional or interchangeable with other components
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow for a very limited amount of layout flexibility
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        A convenience component's interface is itself pretty rigid and resistant to change to ensure
        that the internal overhead of maintaining the component is minimized. So, adding features to a
        convenience component is a rare occurrence, and this could be another reason you might need to
        implement your own composition instead of using a convenience component.

</ol>
