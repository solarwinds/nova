<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    <code><a href="../classes/Scale.html" target="_blank">Scale</a></code> is
    the abstract projection of your domain specific data value boundaries to
    screen pixel range. Generally speaking, it lets you to convert any data
    value into pixel based coordinates on the screen and vice versa. Because of
    that scales are extremely handy when you build your own
    <a
        href="../additional-documentation/advanced-usage/renderers.html"
        target="_parent"
        >Renderer</a
    >. Nova scale is an extended version of
    <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#d3-scale" target="_blank"
        >D3 Scale</a
    >.

    And, they are also used for tick generation and tick label formatting. But,
    in addition to formatting for tick labels, a scale can have the whole set of
    <a

        target="_parent"

    to be used for various purposes.
</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>
    Every scale is defined by its <strong>domain</strong> and
    <strong>range</strong>. The range will be set by the chart itself and will
    represent the amount of screen space that is available for rendering.
    Meanwhile, the domain is controlled by a data provider (it's you) and allows
    for plenty of possibilities. Some of those possiblities are described on the
    dedicated
    <a
        href="../additional-documentation/advanced-usage/scales/domains.html"
        target="_parent"
        >Domains</a
    >
    page.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    As a user of the chart framework you will usually need to provide a couple
    of scales with your
    <code
        ><a href="../interfaces/IChartSeries.html" target="_blank"
            >IChartSeries</a
        ></code
    >. Don't know how to do it? You may find it helpful to start with the
    <a
        href="../additional-documentation/advanced-usage/basics.html"
        target="_parent"
        >Chart Basics</a
    >
    page first.
</p>
<p>
    But, if you're ready to create a scale, just instantiate any class that
    implements the
    <code><a href="../interfaces/IScale.html" target="_blank">IScale</a></code>
    interface. Let's use
    <code
        ><a href="../classes/LinearScale.html" target="_blank"
            >LinearScale</a
        ></code
    >
    as an example:
</p>
<pre>{{ scaleDefinition }}</pre>

<h2>Scale ID</h2>
<p>
    Scales are reusable and can be shared between multiple charts. Scales are
    identified by the value of their
    <code>id</code> field. It can be passed as a parameter on scale
    instantiation, otherwise it will be autogenerated.
</p>
<pre>{{ scaleWithId }}</pre>
