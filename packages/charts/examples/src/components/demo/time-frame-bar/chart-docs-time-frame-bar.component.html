<h1>Time Frame Bar</h1>

<p>
    This example shows the current way of implementing a chart with zooming
    capability and a time frame bar. We don't provide components that would
    encapsulate this logic, so it needs to be implemented from scratch like
    this. It takes advantage of the filtering session implementation to connect
    the filtering components on the page.
