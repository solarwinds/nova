<h1>Implementing a Custom Widget</h1>

<p>
    In the
    <a href="../additional-documentation/tutorials/customization/configurator-section.html" target="_parent">Custom Configurator Section</a>
    tutorial, we talked about giving users the ability to configure a widget behavior or layout that's
    not configurable out of the box. This includes such things as providing a product-specific way for
    users to configure a data source. That tutorial covered the first step to achieving something like
    this by demonstrating how to replace an existing widget configurator (editor) section with your own
    implementation. In this tutorial, we'll go a step further and create a custom widget that actually
    reacts to changes triggered by users as they interact with the custom configurator section.
</p>
<p>
    To keep things simple we'll create a custom widget body and reuse the standard
    <code><a href="../components/WidgetHeaderComponent.html" target="_blank">WidgetHeaderComponent</a></code>
    as our header. The widget body will consist of a
    <code><a href="https://nova-ui.solarwinds.io/bits/release_v11.x/components/ImageComponent.html"
             target="_blank">nui-image</a></code>,
    and we'll create a custom configurator section that can be used to update the source url of the
    image. In a later tutorial, we'll create a custom data source configurator section and go over the
    small amount of additional wiring required to give users the ability to change the configuration of a
    data source.

    <strong>Note:</strong> Implementing a custom widget should be an extremely rare occurrence, and it
    should be done only with the utmost caution. If you or someone on your team is thinking about
    implementing one, please discuss it with UX leadership and the Nova development team before
    proceeding.

</ul>

<h2>Basic Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Follow the instructions
        <a href="../additional-documentation/getting-started.html" target="_parent">here</a> to set up
        your environment for dashboard development.
    </li>
    <li>
        Follow the instructions from previous tutorials to get a basic dashboard up and running.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a component that will serve as the custom widget body. In this tutorial, the widget body
        will consist of a simple <code>nui-image</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a component that will serve as the custom configurator section. In this tutorial,
        the custom configurator section will allow users to update the source url for the image in the
        custom widget.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that <code>NuiImageModule</code> is included in the imports of the custom widget component's
        parent module.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the following modules are included in the imports of the custom
        configurator section component's parent module:
        <code><a href="../modules/NuiDashboardConfiguratorModule.html" target="_blank">NuiDashboardConfiguratorModule</a></code>,
        <code>NuiFormFieldModule</code>, <code>NuiSelectV2Module</code>,
        <code>NuiIconModule</code>, and Angular's
        <code><a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule" target="_blank">ReactiveFormsModule</a></code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the custom widget body and configurator section component class names to the declarations of
        the module(s) in which they're implemented. In this example, the class names are
        <code>CustomWidgetBodyContentComponent</code> and <code>CustomConfiguratorSectionComponent</code>
        respectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare the dashboard framework to use our custom components by doing the following:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Register the new widget type using the
                <code><a href="../classes/WidgetTypesService.html" target="_blank">WidgetTypesService</a></code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Register the custom widget body and custom configurator section components using the
                <code><a href="../injectables/ComponentRegistryService.html" target="_blank">ComponentRegistryService</a></code>.
                This will make them available for late load by the dashboard framework.
            </li>
            <li>
                Initialize the image source url options to be displayed in the custom configurator
                section dropdown using the
                <code><a href="../classes/WidgetTypesService.html" target="_blank">WidgetTypesService</a></code>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <nui-message type="info" [allowDismiss]="false">
            <strong>Note:</strong> In this tutorial, the above three steps are performed in the
            component's <code>ngOnInit</code>. But, in a real-world app, widget type modifications and
            component registrations like this may make more sense in a parent module's constructor.
            Moving framework initialization procedures such as these to a higher level in an app's
            hierarchy ensures that multiple dashboard instances within a common parent module have access
            to the same modifications.

    </li>
    <li>
        At this point you should have a custom widget on the dashboard that displays an image.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should also be able to open the widget editor using the Edit button in the menu at the
        top-right corner of the widget and see the custom configurator section in the editor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Changing the image selection in the dropdown should update the image in the widget preview.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clicking the Save Changes button in the editor should update the widget on the dashboard to show
        the newly selected image.
    </li>
</ol>
