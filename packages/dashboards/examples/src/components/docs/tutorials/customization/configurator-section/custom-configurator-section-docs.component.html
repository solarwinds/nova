<h1>Implementing a Custom Configurator Section</h1>

<p>
    While developing a dashboard, you may find yourself wanting to give users the ability to configure a
    widget behavior or layout that's not configurable out of the box. For example, you may want to
    provide a product-specific way for users to configure a data source. The first step to achieving
    something like this is to replace an existing widget configurator (editor) section with your own
    implementation. In this tutorial, we'll do our best to give you an understanding of what's needed to
    accomplish this first step.
</p>
<p>
    For now, we'll keep things simple and create a custom version of the KPI description configuration
    component to replace the background color selector with some static text content. This will serve
    mainly as a proof-of-concept for the configurator side. In a
    later tutorial, we'll create a
    <a href="../additional-documentation/tutorials/customization/widget.html" target="_parent">custom widget</a>
    that can actually be configured via a custom configurator section. And, in another tutorial beyond
    that, we'll go over the small amount of additional wiring required to give users the ability to
    change the configuration of a data source.

        Custom configurator section component

</ul>

<h2>Basic Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Follow the instructions
        <a href="../additional-documentation/getting-started.html" target="_parent">here</a> to set up
        your environment for dashboard development.
    </li>
    <li>
        Follow the instructions from previous tutorials to get a basic dashboard up and running.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a component that will be used to replace an existing framework-provided configurator
        section. In this tutorial, we'll replace the existing
        <code><a href="../components/KpiDescriptionConfigurationComponent.html" target="_blank">KpiDescriptionConfigurationComponent</a></code>
        with a custom one. Our version will insert custom content where there would normally be a tile
        color selection dropdown.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the following modules are included in the imports of the custom configurator section
        component's parent module:
        <code><a href="../modules/NuiDashboardConfiguratorModule.html" target="_blank">NuiDashboardConfiguratorModule</a></code>,
        <code>NuiFormFieldModule</code>, <code>NuiTextboxModule</code>,
        <code>NuiIconModule</code>, and Angular's
        <code><a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule" target="_blank">ReactiveFormsModule</a></code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the custom configurator section component class name to the declarations of the module in
        which it's implemented. In this example, the class name is
        <code>CustomKpiDescriptionConfigurationComponent</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare the dashboard framework to use our custom configurator section by doing the following:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use the
                <code><a href="../classes/WidgetTypesService.html" target="_blank">WidgetTypesService</a></code>
                to replace the existing configurator section component with our custom one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Register the custom configurator section component using the
                <code><a href="../injectables/ComponentRegistryService.html" target="_blank">ComponentRegistryService</a></code>
                to make it available for late load by the dashboard framework.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <strong>Note:</strong> In this tutorial, the above two steps are performed in the
            component's <code>ngOnInit</code>. But, in a real-world app, widget type modifications and
            component registrations like this may make more sense in a parent module's constructor.
            Moving framework initialization procedures such as these to a higher level in an app's
            hierarchy ensures that multiple dashboard instances within a common parent module have access
            to the same modifications.

        At this point you should be able to open the widget editor using the Edit button in the menu at
        the top-right corner of the widget. Once the editor is open, expand the KPI tile's Description
        section. The custom component we created should now be displayed in that section of the editor.
    </li>
    <li>
        In case you have custom content, like formatters etc., and you use <code>nui-select-v2</code> and <code>nui-combobox-v2</code> components,
        it is possible that in case of large lists the component overlay may go beyond the configurator heading due to its high z-index. To fix this,
        use the <code>nui-select-v2</code> and <code>nui-combobox-v2</code> components input <code>popupViewportMargin</code> and pass the height of 
        the configurator heading into it. You can get the height of the configurator heading by simply injecting the 
        <code><a href="../injectables/ConfiguratorHeadingService.html" target="_blank">ConfiguratorHeadingService</a></code>
        and use its <code>height$</code> observable and async pipe to instantly get the current height of the configurator heading.
