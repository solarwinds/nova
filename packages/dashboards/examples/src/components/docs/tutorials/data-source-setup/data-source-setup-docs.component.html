<h1>Adding a Data Source</h1>

<p>
    In basic terms, a data source is an entity from which a widget on the dashboard gets its data. In the
    context of the dashboards framework, a data source is a dependency that gets injected just like any
    other provider for use by a widget via Angular's built-in dependency injection (DI) mechanism. As
    we'll see, the DI for a dependency in Nova Dashboards is very similar to that used in Nova Bits and 
    other Angular-based libraries with one major difference: a dependency must be registered with a 
    provider registry to make the dashboard framework aware of its availability for injection. In this 
    tutorial, we'll go into some detail about this and other basics of how to set up a data source.

<h2>Basic Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Follow the instructions
        <a href="../additional-documentation/getting-started.html" target="_parent">here</a> to set up
        your environment for dashboard development.
    </li>
    <li>
        Follow the instructions from the
        <a href="../additional-documentation/tutorials/hello-dashboards.html" target="_parent">Hello Dashboards</a>
        tutorial to get a basic dashboard up and running.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement your data source (See the example source below for a basic implementation).
        <nui-message type="info" [allowDismiss]="false">
            <strong>Note:</strong> It's recommended to have the data source in a separate file. If you do
            put it in a separate file, don't forget to add <code>@Injectable()</code> to the top of the
            data source class. This lets Angular know that you plan on injecting dependencies into it.
        </nui-message>
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that Angular's <code>HttpClientModule</code> is included in the imports of the module that
        contains the data source. You can go
        <a href="https://angular.io/guide/http#setup" target="_blank">here</a> for more information about
        http setup.
        <nui-message type="info" [allowDismiss]="false">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Importing <code>HttpClientModule</code> is required in this example
            because the data source depends on the <code>HttpClient</code> service.
        </nui-message>
    </li>
    <li>
        Register the data source as a dynamically injectable provider using the
        <a href="../injectables/ProviderRegistryService.html" target="_blank"><code>ProviderRegistryService</code></a>.
        <nui-message type="warning" [allowDismiss]="false">
            <strong>Note:</strong> When registering a class provider using the ProviderRegistryService,
            be sure to include in the <code>deps</code> array any dependencies that need to be injected
            into the provider. This is demonstrated in the example below.
        </nui-message>
    </li>
    <li>Set the data source's provider ID in the widget configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    In the example below, we're statically setting the data source providerId for the tile
    inside the KPI widget. In a real-world scenario, the tile configuration would more likely
    come from a database or from the widget configurator output. We'll cover
    configurator usage in the Widget Editing and Widget Cloning tutorials.
