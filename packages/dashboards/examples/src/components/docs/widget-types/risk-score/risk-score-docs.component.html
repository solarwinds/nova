<h1>Risk Score Widget</h1>

<p>
    Risk Score indicators are quantifiable measures designed to
    track any metrics of a monitored system. The Risk Score widget displays the current
    measurement of a Risk Score as a color level value on the scale from green to red 
    and can display one or more individual metrics within a single widget instance.
    It's useful for highlighting and promoting easy comprehension of key metrics.
