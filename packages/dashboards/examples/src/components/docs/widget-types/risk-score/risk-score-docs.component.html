<h1>Risk Score Widget</h1>

<p>
    Risk Score indicators are quantifiable measures designed to
    track any metrics of a monitored system. The KPI widget displays the current
    measurement of a KPI as a single numeric value and can display one or more
    individual metrics within a single widget instance. It's useful for
    highlighting and promoting easy comprehension of key metrics. Additionally,
    each KPI within a widget instance can visualize associated thresholds via a
    dynamic background color indicating whether a certain threshold has been
    reached.
