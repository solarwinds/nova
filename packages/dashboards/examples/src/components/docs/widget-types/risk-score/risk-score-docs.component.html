<h1>Risk Score Widget</h1>

<p>
    Risk Score indicators are quantifiable measures designed to track any
    metrics of a monitored system. The Risk Score widget displays the current
    measurement of a Risk Score as a color level value on a gradient scale from
    green to red and can display one or more individual metrics within a single
    widget instance. It's useful for highlighting and promoting easy
    comprehension of key metrics.
