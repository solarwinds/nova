# Nova Nui Framework

The Nova Nui Framework provides a set of common UI-based components and services to assist with rapid web application development. Nui is built on the latest Angular and follows modern UX design principles and front-end software development practices.

## Style Guide

The Nova UI coding Style Guide can be found [here](./docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md#style-guide).

## Project Structure 

Nova UI consists of three packages within a single monorepo:

* [Bits](./packages/bits/README.md#bits-overview) - A set of atomic components to be used as building blocks for applications and more complex 
components. Exception - **convenience components** - prototypes of composite components, that are meant 
to accommodate a wide breadth of use cases.
* [Charts](./packages/charts/README.md#charts-overview) - A visualization library built on top of [d3](https://d3js.org/).
* [Dashboards](./packages/dashboards/README.md#dashboards-overview) - A framework designed to provide developers a solution 
for presenting data coming from various sources within a single view.

## Contributions

We encourage [contributions to Nova](./docs/CONTRIBUTION.md#contributing-to-nova) whenever your team needs a new component, new functionality in an existing component, new icons, bug fixes or atom extensions.
