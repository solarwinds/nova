# Definition of Done

- Component styles conform and behavior to the [Nova Design System](https://ux.solarwinds.io/design/). Note - we may not implement all behavior outlined in component mockups, but all behavior implemented must conform to the specs.
- Any necessary externally facing technical documentation created/updated
  - For components and libraries. API docs pages are created and complete with the following tabs:
    - Overview - this tab provides explanations of a component and its behavior along with examples for each feature/option.
    - API - the whole API surface of a component/entity is documented. For components, this includes all inputs and outputs. For services and other exported classes, this includes all public members and methods.
- Peer code review completed
- Source code has been merged to main branch
- Resulting main branch build is successful
- For components and library features:
  - At least 2 user sessions completed where the feedback has been incorporated
  - SDLC component status is set on docs Example page
- Cross-cutting concerns are addressed and tested
  - Ensure all strings are internationalized (note - translations are not provided by Nova UI)
  - Performance
  - Ensure component/entity supports a11y
    - keyboard navigation is supported
    - [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute)
  - Security (where applicable)
- New behavior has been manually tested and verified
- Changes tested in all [supported browsers](./docs/FAQ.md#what-browsers-are-supported-by-nova-ui)
- Automation tests (visual / unit / e2e / atoms) have been created and are passing
  - Strongly favor unit tests over e2e/visual
  - Business logic (e.g. controllers, services, filters, etc) should be unit tested - goal for coverage is at least 80%.
  - Integration tests (i.e. tests for how components interact with one another) should be done e2e.
  - Minimize e2e - avoid e2e tests for those things that can be unit or visually tested
  - Visual and e2e tests satisfy the code owners. The PR is a good spot for this.
  - Atom(s) should be written for each component
- Any defects for critical functionality are fixed. Some examples of critical functionality:
  - Anything that prevents a feature developer from employing a component/lib
  - Anything that prevents an end-user from accomplishing their job
